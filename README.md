# Internal-Telephone-Directory

This is my first technical project ive created in C# since i started learning the language in September.

I have written a programme that stores the Names, Numbers and Job Titles of a company's list of employees in C#. I have used User Defined Data-Types, File Manipulation, Functions and Error Trapping/Input Validation along with other programming methods to make this programme.

This whole project was coded online using Repl, which requires all functiions to have the "static" keyword infront of them.
